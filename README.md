# Try the live version of the project here:

## Live Demo in AWS
[Restaurant Rating Prediction App in AWS](http://restaurantratingprediction-env.eba-mgzctncn.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

## Live Demo in Render
[Restaurant Rating Prediction App in Render](https://restaurant-rating-prediction-yw9u.onrender.com)

### Important Notes
- The application is hosted on Render's free tier, which puts the server to sleep after a period of inactivity. As a result, it may take 1-2 minutes for the app to load initially.
- Once the server is active, subsequent requests will load much faster.
  

## About This Project
The project uses machine learning models like Random Forest and other classifiers to predict restaurant ratings. The features include location, cuisine type, and customer feedback, and the application is deployed using AWS and Render.
